### 🔍 Project Overview

The primary focus of this repository is to learn and experiment with **FastAPI**, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

While the project includes a basic Machine Learning model (for demonstration purposes), the depth of ML in this repo is **intentionally minimal** — the core emphasis is on building a working API around it using FastAPI.
